Client and server Communication
=====================================
Client and server communicate through the IP(Internet Protocol) Address. 
Client sends the request for the server to display a particular web page by using IP address
of the server. Then server gives the response to the client.

Why DNS is required
====================

DNS means Domain Name Server which converts the ip address to domain name. 
Suppose if we are having the url http://www.facebook.com.
->When the client enters facebook.com the DNS converts the domain name to ip address and downloads the 
  webpage to the local computer.
->DNS is required because the client will be unable to enter the IP addresses every time to open a 
   website as the IP addresses changes randomly
